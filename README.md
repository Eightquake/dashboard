## Dashboard
#### A project that's mainly so that I can learn Electron. Currently, don't expect a perfect dashboard out of this.
<br>
This is my first time using Electron so if you find any problems with my code feel free to open a issue and tell me about it! I'd love to get some feedback.

Hopefully this will turn into something usable. If you want to use this yourself have a look at the releases as they should be stable to use, if there are any. The code that is not in a release should be treated as in development and no guarantees are given for the stability.
This repo only includes a introduction plugin and detail, check out [my other repo](https://github.com/Eightquake/dashboard-modules) to see what plugins and details I use.

Have a look at my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/sCPiCzS1) to see what I am currently working on and what I have planned. Comments are open on the board but you cannot edit it in any other way.
